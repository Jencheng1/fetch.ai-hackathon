# Medius.ai


**Inspiration**

_Our project started with a disconnection_
Healthcare, law enforcement, social services, and first responders often face critical inefficiencies in communication due to patient privacy regulations and siloed information systems. These challenges can lead to delayed or suboptimal decisions, risking patient outcomes and organizational performance. We were inspired to create Medius AI—a SaaS platform—to bridge these gaps and streamline collaboration across sectors.

**What it does**

Medius AI is a SaaS solution that securely facilitates collaborative communication between professionals in healthcare, social services, first response, and law enforcement. It ensures privacy by anonymizing patient profiles and using role-based access controls. The platform integrates AI-driven features such as predictive analytics and a RAG chatbot to provide actionable treatment recommendations, access logs, and compliance with privacy regulations.

**How we built it**

Backend: Multi-agent architecture, including a Guardian Agent for enforcing privacy and a Responder Agent for role-specific data requests.
Frontend: Built with Streamlit to provide a user-friendly interface for diverse roles, such as paramedics, social workers, and psychiatrists.
AI Integration: LangChain powers knowledge retrieval, Pinecone manages vector embeddings, and the RAG-enhanced chatbot synthesizes data into actionable insights.
Privacy: Robust role-based access controls and anonymized patient identifiers ensure compliance and security.

**Challenges we ran into**

Ensuring compliance with complex healthcare privacy laws while maintaining operational efficiency.
Designing a system that dynamically adapts to varying access needs across roles.
Creating seamless integration between the multi-agent architecture and the RAG chatbot.

**Accomplishments that we're proud of**

Successfully developed a SaaS platform that balances privacy and collaboration.
